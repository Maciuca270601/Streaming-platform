# About the code
    This is an idea of implementing a simple platform which provides information
about movies and tv shows.
    An important goal of the project was to give users personalized recommendations
based on their preferences.

## Structure
    The homework is divided in several packages which contain classes that share
the same utility. In order to solve the homework I have added the following:

* package entities: -> Actor
                    -> Database
                    -> Movie
                    -> Season
                    -> Serial
                    -> User
                    -> Video
Description: Since my platform is working with users, movies, tv shows and more, I needed
to create my own objects which then I have stored in specific arrays which could be found
in Database. The later also contains important functions that help me filter some of these
arrays or sort them based on some filters or different criteria.

* package parser: -> Parser
Description: This class has two main functions that help me build the Database in which I have
stored all of my objects and also build the Tasks where I have stored all of my commands, queries
and recommendations respectively.

* package solver: -> CommandSolver
                  -> QuerySolver
                  -> RecommendationSolver
                  -> Solver
Description: As the title says all of these classes solve specific tasks.
CommandSolver is being used in order to solve all the commands I have received from input,
and same goes for QuerySolver and RecommendationSolver. The Solver class iterates through
all of my tasks and decides the type of action in order to solve it with the specific class.

* package tasks: -> Command
                 -> Query
                 -> Recommendation
                 -> Tasks
Description: The principle here is similar to Database which stores all of my objects.
In this case the database is called Tasks and its objects are commands, queries and or
recommendations.

### Difficulties
    I had a lot of trouble deciding how I want to implement my homework, how should I divide
my code into classes and packages but after making an overall idea of how should I approach it,
it all went smooth and I have managed to pass all the tests.
